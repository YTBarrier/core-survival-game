## Version 0.3.0
There is a light source located at the middle of the world(100 feet high). The material type for the plane, trees, and the rocks has been updated from MeshBasicMaterial to MeshLambertMaterial, so that it shades relative to light. Shadows are also casted on all objects now.

## Patch 0.2.1
Added title to top of screen, and changed where Alpha Testing Phase text is.
## Version 0.2.0
Trees and rocks are now rendered. There are 5 trees and three rocks. Collision detection is not active yet.

## Version 0.0.0
This is the launch version. Camera can be rotated by moving mouse and you can move around with WASD. Inventory slots are also rendered in the top right corner, and coordinates in the top left.
